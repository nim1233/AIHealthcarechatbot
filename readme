This project is a mini AI powered chatbot. This chatbot is supposed to stimulate a hospital system database which has recorded the data for patients and their result on a genetic test. A positive result on this test indicates increased risk of disease.  

In the excel.py file you will find code meant to generate a random list of patient names, ages, gender, genetic test results, and the medications they are currently taking. 

This chatbot asks for patient name and returns their patient information as well as lifestyle reccomendations for those diagnosed with a positive test result.  Additionally, it will ask if you want to perform a medical analysis for the patient. If you opt for a medical analysis of your patient, it will search its data base for medications the patient is currently taking/age of the patient and reccomend the optimial medication that can be used as to avoid any problems with current medication/age. For more information, read the definitions.py file. 

This chatbot is not meant to be used to reccomend medication on its own or for health advise. This was created solely for learning purposes. I initiated this project to investigate the potential role of AI in the evolving landscape of telehealth, particularly when guided by the expertise of medical physicians.
